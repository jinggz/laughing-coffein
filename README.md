An idea to build my personal knowledge pool for reviews of coffee 
Since I started to learn knowledge of coffee and always have difficulties of choosing beans and image their tastes, I have been thinking how to discover my favor of coffee in a smart way. Then I started to take notes of coffees that I tried, and then think if I can pool some stuffs from them. That is how I got the idea. How about I structured all my notes, digitalized them, and do some data minings and see if I can find my own perference. And the more furthur goal could be expand it to other topics.
# Knowledge might useful
data mining, nlp, sentiment analysis, recommend system.
# Idea of data
each note is a .json file // structured it in different aspect: offical description, actual experience //
Offical description: price, flavor, Origin, method, height, variaties...//
need to restrict/standardliaze the words that can be used to describe the same aspective
